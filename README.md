# simple-HSL-app
Node.js application for querying bus information (in the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland).
The purpose of this application is for the user to maybe set up an info screen in their home with raspberry pi or equivalent.
The goal is for the user to see when their regular bus leaves next.

Currently WIP.

Todo:
* Moving from Bootstrap to MDL
* Improving the user experience
  * Fixed start and end points (Works pretty well if the points are fixed, scaling ruined the user experience, explained below)
  * Implementing the graphql requests with callbacks (Currently, the lack of callback functions makes using this application is quite horrible.)
