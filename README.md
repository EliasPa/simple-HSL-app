# Simple HSL API demo
An app that's used for querying bus data in the Helsinki metropolitan area (HSL).
Please note: This application will not work with legs containing multiple buses, this app was designed simply for me to check my regular bus as easily as possible.
However, you can test this application here: https://simple-bus-app.herokuapp.com/ . But please make sure you use the actual stop names.

Currently WIP.
